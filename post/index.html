      I’ve mentioned before that a great coding practice you can ingrain into your work is unit testing. The idea is simple: you write a script that automatically evaluates pieces of your code and checks it against expected behavior. For example, a correlation coefficient should always be between -1 and 1, so you could write a test that will raise an error if it encounters an r beyond these values. Or, you could check your data file after it’s read in to make sure it reads in with all rows and columns, nothing missing where it shouldn’t be, and every column of the data type you want it.

      This notebook is based loosely on this cheatsheet that shows some of the most basic functionality of R notebooks, including code, markdown, and Latex.
Code Chunks You can imbed chunks of R code right into the notebooks and run them. Why not beat that long-dead horse of demo data, the iris dataset?

      One of the ways we can increase transparency in science, in addition to posting our data, materials, and pre-registering our methods, is to start including more information about our raw data in our write-ups and reports. One of the ways we can do this is just show it in a visualization.
The bar chart with error bars (usually (\pm 1.96 \times) standard error for a 95% confidence interval) is a classic plot type, but it obscures a lot of information about the underlying distribution that generated it.

      I found this Twitter thread on the vagaries of data wrangling killing momentum interesting, particularly the notion of how frustrating it must be to be at point A with your data, see Point B, where you’d like to go, and have no idea how to get there. Even for those with programming experience, data wrangling can be an enormous chore.
To that end, I thought I’d walk through a basic overview of how to accomplish some of the operations you might commonly encounter when you first get a data set.

      The bootstrap, detailed by Efron and Tibshirani in their 1993 book An Introduction to the Bootstrap, is a powerful, flexible statistical concept based on the idea of “pulling yourself up by your bootstraps.” With today’s computing power, it’s easier than ever to apply and use. It also happens to be one of my favorite statistical tricks because of the elegance of the underlying logic.
The idea behind the bootstrap is simple.

      Psych researchers have a bit of a reputation for being, shall we say, less-than-delicate programmers. It’s common to hear “it doesn’t matter if it’s ugly, as long as it works.”
I took computer science classes as an undergrad, and style was rigidly enforced. I had one notoriously strict professor who would dock up to a grade on an otherwise completely functional project if it was ugly. It wasn’t just simple elitism; ugly code is often inefficient code, and ugly code is hard to read and understand.

      If it’s not terribly obvious, Shiny is my new favorite toy. It’s incredibly accessible for beginners, gives you great results with minimal effort, and can be as sophisticated as you need it to be.
I decided to throw together a quick simulation to look at the variation in effect size estimates we can expect at different sample sizes. There’s an increasing focus in psych on estimation of effects, rather than simply detection of effects.

      I will finish grad school a child of the replication crisis. My year and a half in grad school has been marked by bombshell failures-to-replicate, increasing adoption of Bayesian methods, and wider recognition of the insidious effects of questionable research practices.
In many ways, I’m lucky. I didn’t have to make changes to the way I did things to adhere to better practices. I got to start with openness as one of the core tenets of how I conduct my research, and starting fresh is always easier than having to alter pre-existing patterns of behavior.

      FiveThirtyEight posts math, logic, and probability puzzles each week. I was tempted by this week’s Riddler Express:
 On snowy afternoons, you like to play a solitaire “game” with a standard, randomly shuffled deck of 52 cards. You start dealing cards face up, one at a time, into a pile. As you deal each card, you also speak aloud, in order, the 13 card faces in a standard deck: ace, two, three, etc.
